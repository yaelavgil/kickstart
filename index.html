        <p>
            I was born on June 1982 in Haifa, Israel and moved to Nahariya when I was 3 years old.
            <br/>In the last four years I'm living in Tel-Aviv and I'm loving it!
            <br/>I'm married to my best friend, Roi.
            <br/>We have a two years old daughter, Danni
            and a two and a half years old dog, Sasha.
